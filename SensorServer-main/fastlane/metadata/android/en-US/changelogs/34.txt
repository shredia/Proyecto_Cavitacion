New Feature : Service Discovery Support
The app now supports Zero-configuration networking (Zeroconf/mDNS), enabling automatic server discovery on local networks. This feature eliminates the need for clients to hardcode IP addresses and port numbers when connecting to the WebSocket server. When enabled by the app user, the server broadcasts its presence on the network using the service type "_websocket._tcp", allowing clients to discover the server automatically. Clients can now implement service discovery to locate the server dynamically, rather than relying on hardcoded network configurations.
